# 🚀 KWS – Self-Hosted Developer Cloud Platform

**Build. Deploy. Access. Instantly.**

KWS is a self-hosted cloud platform that lets developers and students deploy their apps in secure, containerized environments — and access them privately or publicly with ease.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔒 Secure VPN-Based Access
Every deployed container is accessible privately through a VPN — ensuring network isolation and control.

### 💻 Browser-Based VS Code for Every Instance
Each container comes with a live, browser-accessible VS Code IDE.
Access it from a unique URL like:  
`<container-id>.kwscloud.in`

No setup needed. Just open, code, and run.

### 🗃️ Built-In PostgreSQL Management
Use powerful managed PostgreSQL from your web dashboard.
- No need to install Postgres in containers
- Add databases and users with scoped access
- Users can't elevate privileges inside the DB

### 🌐 One-Click Public Hosting
Deploy your app and make it public in seconds.  
Just select a subdomain and port — your app is live at:  
`<your-app>.kwscloud.in`

No manual DNS or reverse proxy config required.

### 🧰 Full Instance Control
From your dashboard, you can:
- Start/Stop/Kill containers
- Redeploy at any time
- Monitor public and private endpoints
